## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)?  
   **Answer:** As I am completing this report, I am planning on submitting this document before the end of the day on Monday, Oct 7.

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?  
   **Answer:** Yes every week we have it planned that we meet at 4:00PM at the CITL. During the meeting we speak about our upcomming duties that we each have and make sure that we are prepared for the week. In those meetings we let each other know to start early so that we have time saved if we have problems. This week unfortunatley due to me being sick, we were unable to meet in person, but we still met on Zoom and discussed the usual. We were even able to speak to Robert and ask him questions.

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.  
   **Answer:** As a whole we were able to meet all the requirements that were located in the rubric. As individuals each person fully completed the part of the rubric that was assigned to them. We assigned ourselves but each person fulfilled their duties. We were able to do this successfully because we were able to ask Robert for questions, since we had a slight problem of over designing but we were able to pull back. We did not obviously complete too much code since we were not really supposed to but we did lay out the building blocks that will be followed when creating and implementing the code. Every member, Sean, Monica, Matyas, Evan, and I completed our assigned task to the complete satisfaction both individually and collectively. We were able to balance the work along with our other assignments because we kept checking in on each other seeing where we were.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"  
    **Answer:** Were able to complete this sprint successfully and we have completely laid out the framework for the upcoming implementation sprint. We know what we want to see how the mobile and web app should look for this upcoming sprint. We have everything settled. We know we were able to complete to a satisfactory level since we all agreed on what we had in the end as a team, and it met all the requirements for the actual sprint.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"  
    **Answer:** We did not implement any code as we were not supposed to this sprint but we did review our work and tasks that we were supposed to complete. Whenever one of us would finish their task we would share it in the Slack Channel and provide feedback on what we had and what we should add or remove. So while there was no actual “code review” we did review each other’s work.

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?  
    **Answer:** During the meeting that we do weekly as a team we always make sure to end it in a way that outlines what we should do. Examples could be to work on the videos first by Friday and then start on the sprint. There are many variations in how we close each meeting but one thing that is constantly said at the end of the meeting is to complete work as soon as possible. It’s a reminder that we need to go through with our work and not hold it off.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?  
    **Answer:** While personally I did not mention this point, which is incorrect and I will make sure to mention this point in the future, we did make it clear to provide work on slack channel to review and help team members. So although I never explicitly mentioned it, we did help one another whenever we did need help. I believe that this also comes down to how we as a team are very supportive of each other and it shows through our interactions.

8. How well is the team communicating?  
    **Answer:** The team is communicating very well with each other. We make sure to be clear to each other if we run into problems, how our schedule is looking and how we are just feeling in general. Just this week we had to meet but there were a lot of difficulties with picking a time. We each expressed how we felt and what we thought and moved forward from there, we were able to come to a conclusion that everyone was happy with. We make sure not to delay communication so that we can come to a solution without jeopardizing the team.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.  
    **Answer:** As discussed in the previous question we have held expectations of each other. This is mainly found in communication. We make sure that communication is done right away to solve any problems before getting out of hand. We also had some expectations with the Slack channel. This was because we told each other that we should be putting more communication in the Slack channel so we do not run into these problems.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.  
    **Answer:**  
    * Challenge: Over-Designing App
        * Status: Resolved
        * Description: We were not sure how much we should put into our design and framework and we did have some problems including added an authentication process and having dislikes
        * Critical steps taken to find resolution: We spoke with Robert on how and what needs to be done and he made it clear what was the main point. We then discussed as a team and removed parts that were not going to be able to complete and in the end were able to achieve an attainable goal for the upcoming sprint.


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?  
    **Answer:** We met twice with Robert, the first time being at the recitation. We discussed our problems we were running into and he was able to talk with us one on one to provide clarification and support. It roughly probably added up to 45 minutes in the recitation but were in the recitation for the total times. The second was our weekly meeting. We had to do it on zoom since I was sick, and he dropped by and asked us if we had questions about the rubric and expectations. He answered all our questions and that took roughly about 20 minutes.

1. Describe your use of Trello.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?  
    **Answer:** This was something that I don’t know we were meant to implement, but now that I do I will make sure to use it for our team to make our lives easier when it comes to this project. It seems really helpful for keeping track of everything, and I am disappointed that I did not use this resource earlier.

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?  
    **Answer:** We conduct team meetings by first asking each other how everyone is feeling and doing to see where they are both physically and mentally before we start doing the week’s work. Then we speak about anything that is concerning us in this upcoming sprint for example the amount of work or topics that we are not fully understanding. Then we mention what work each member will do and then we say any last comments or questions. Outside the meeting we mainly speak about work, where we are in the sprint, how everything is coming along and offer our support for anyone that needs it.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.  
    **Answer:** Well this week since we had used the Jira board, I decided to make sure to divide up the work and assign it to each member so they know exactly what to do if they were slightly confused. We use Slack and it is our most valuable resource since we use it to discuss problems for clarification and or guidance and provide check boxes to see if they are moving along smoothly. The slack channel is especially helpful in regard to mitigating risks since we encourage each other to speak about any concerns or problems they are having.

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?  
    **Answer:** There was no difficulties really in our group interactions but something I noticed about myself as the PM was that I was not communicative enough as a PM, I was demanding which is both a good thing but also a bad thing, since there was no real guidance on my end, but I believe that this was also because of my illness and therefore physically I was not in the best of states to be more talkative.

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?  
    **Answer:** The biggest concern that I have seen is just time. We want to make sure to complete everything successfully but also in a timely manner so we are not in the end rushing ourselves with our work. The biggest concern in my eyes is like what I mentioned previously, I believe I am not communicative enough as a PM and that is something I need to work on so we have a better understanding of each other.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.  
    **Answer:** This week was again just time, and the fact that I was sick, I believe that it caused quite a bit of issues since it took a while for me to complete my tasks because my body was physically exhausted. And in regards to time we just need to make sure that were able to complete everything before the deadline but because of my Illness and the rate I was completing my work it took a while, although in the end we were able to submit it on time

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?  
    **Answer:** I think we just need to start completing the work earlier as a team so that we can not rush into the end. It has not been that much of a problem but it does not have to be resolved. That being said it is only really regarding me, for the most part as a team we complete things well before it’s due. I don’t believe there is anything we have to stop. In regards to something we need to continue, I believe it’s our communication. We communicate regularly and we are very clear with our teammates and I believe that is really important for our group relationship.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?  
    **Answer:** Well I thought there was not much to do and since I was sick I kind of moved it off but then when I got even more sick and we had even less time, I noticed that our time estimates greatly changed and I was concerned I was not going to be able to complete everything as PM on time, but thankfully we were able to. That is something I need to work on and I am planning on changing these habits right away.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?  
    **Answer:** I believe that there would not be much concern on the customer's end, the only thing I could think of is maybe there is not much functionality, but that is also just because we started our project as a team only recently. And we do not have other knowledge to implement account authentication and things like that.
