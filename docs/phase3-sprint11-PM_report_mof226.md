## General questions

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)? 

    Yes, the PM for this week did submit this report.

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?

    Yes, the team has meetings every Thursday.

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.

    All the requirements of this sprint were met. We met in person and discussed the new design for this phase so that everyone had a clear idea of what needed to be updated in the artifacts. Then we divided the artifacts amongst oursleves so that each person had their own artifacts to work on. We updated the artifacts according to the new functionality of being able to upload files/images. During this period of design, if anyone had questions, they asked it in either slack or on our zoom call and they were discussed among the team. We all got together on zoom and reviewed the artifacts to make sure we were all in agreement with how the design should be.
    

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"
    * If incomplete, what challenges are being overcome, how are they being overcome, and by when will the team member be able to finish?
    * If complete, how do you know everyone completed the work, and at a satisfactory level?

    As of right now, our status is good. We completed all the required artifacts for the design phase and we are ready to start coding. I know we are at a good status because we met on zoom and reviewed all the artifacts together and recorded our video together also.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"

    I confirmed our status by setting up a zoom meeting. We all submitted out artifacts onto slack and reviewed them together. If anyone had any suggestions for changes, they would speak up and let the person know. It was an open discussion and any questions that someone had about their artifact was answered also.

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?

    Early on in the sprint, I added tasks to the Jira board and assigned these tasks to my teamates. I regularly checked in on my teamates to see how they were progressing throughout the week.

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?

    I encouraged the team to help one another by having the teamates send their artifacts onto slack for everyone to see and we had an open discussion on a zoom call where we would help each other and answer each other's questions.

8. How well is the team communicating?
    
    The team is communicating very well. We communicate through meetings, text messages, and zoom calls. We mostly talk about the sprint we are working on but we also have other side converstions with each other and friendly conversation.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.

    Some expectations that the team expects from one another include being present at every weekly meeting, and regular communication on slack. We also have the expectation of helping each other out when someone needs it.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.

    Nothing for this sprint was challenging or unclear. This was not our first time doing a design sprint, so we were all used to the process and everything went very smoothly.


## Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

0. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?

    We met with our mentor during last class time, which is every Tuesday. It lasted for about a half hour.

1. Describe your use of Jira.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?

    I think we had just enough detail in our Jira board. We don't have any strict policies around its use, but usually it's the PM who creates the tasks on Jira and assigns them to their teamates. Then once each team member finishes their task, they will usually be the one to move the task to the done column. 

2. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?

    We have regular meetings every Thursday and reminders are always sent out to make sure everyone is present. Outside of meetings, we would regularly communicate on slack and sometimes zoom.

3. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, slack use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.

    Some techniques that were used to mitigate risk include checking in with each member of the team to make sure they were making progress on their artifacts, communicating on slack regularly, assigning tasks on jira board, and meeting twice(once in person and second on zoom).

4. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping thins so constructive?

    There were no difficulties in managing the team. I believe our good communication and willingness to help each other is what keeps our team dynamic very strong.

5. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next sprint?

    My biggest concern for the next sprint is the team not starting their work early enough, but I will do my part to check in on the team and encourage them to start.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.

    A difficulty the team faced is figuring out a good time to meet. All our schedules are very busy, so it is not easy sometimes.

7. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?

    I suggest that we start checking in on each other more often, and possibly meet in person an additional day every week.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the sprint? How did your time estimates change as the sprint progressed?

    My estimate of time during the sprint was accurate. We discussed beforehand that we would meet on sunday, the day the sprint was due, to review the artifacts and record our video. This way, our meeting was set in stone, so there were no changes in my time estimate. 

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?

    I don't think the customer would have any concerns because our design is looking really good right now and is thoroughly reviewed by the team to make sure it covers all the new functinality for this phase.
