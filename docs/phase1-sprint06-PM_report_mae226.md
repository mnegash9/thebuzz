## General questions [15 points total]

1. Did the PM for this week submit this report (If not, why not?)?  
    **Answer:** I, the project manager, am currently completing this doucment on time and should be able to submit before the end of Wednesday, Oct 16.

2. Has the team been gathering for a weekly, in-person meeting(s)? If not, why not?  
    **Answer:** Yes, every week we meet at the CITL at 4:00 PM on Thursdays. Unfortunatley for this week, I was very sick and could not be there in person, but we simply moved the meeting to Zoom and we did our usual meeting. We each discussed what each had to do for that sprint. We also make sure to inform each other that if we were stuck that we were able to ask for help regarding their role. Some of the roles began discussing how they were going to interact with each other for example, the frontend-web role was asking the backend role to see how their respective positions were going to interact so that they do not run into problems in the future.

3. Summarize how well the team met the requirements of this sprint.  
    **Answer:** We were able to successfully implement all the code that was both required as seen on the rubric, but we were able to implement everything we had written down during our design phases. Both the web and app operate in a way that we had designed in that respective phase. The backend was able to have all the API endpoints we wanted to have, and the command line admin was able to complete the desired functionality. We also made sure not to over-do the functionality, we did not use complex code that it would be considered beyond the spec. With everything working together we have come to a desired point and individually we were able to fully implement everything we wanted. Everyone in the group was able to balance their work and to make sure they used all the time they had to implement code for this sprint.

4. Report on each member's progress (sprint and phase activity completion) – "what is the status?"  
    **Answer:** We were all able to complete all the tasks we were supposed to do complete in a succesful manner. We know this because when I did code reviews with each member, their code had all the functinality we were looking for coming from the design phase, and also the code itself was written well and was functional when being used and tested. Also during the integration testing we showed all our parts connected to each other and saw their functionality, such as web, mobile, and admin.

5. Summary of "code review" during which each team member discussed and showed their progress – "how did you confirm the status?"  
    **Answer:** Whenever we had implemented a big piece of code that changed or added a functionality we checked the code over to make sure we each were happy with the way it was functioning and how it was being applied. Then we did another code review during recitation. Each member did a pull request, then they met with me going over their entire code and showing the entire functionality they implemented. Once I saw that it met all requirements and was successful and satisfactory for the program, I approved the pull request and merged into pre-main. Also on the Jira Board I could see where everyone was since they had assigned tasks and they moved it to in progress whenever they were working on something or done if they already completed it. So for the majority of the code review it was all scheduled and we knew when we would check the code.

6. What did you do to encourage the team to be working on phase activities "sooner rather than later"?  
    **Answer:** During our team meeting we also make sure to tell everyone to start as soon as possible. For this week when we met on Zoom we made sure to make this explicitly clear especially since this a new type of sprint and we did not want to leave things until the last minute. Also on the Jira board there was a section for the date and that helped everyone realize how much time they had left and made them begin their work earlier

7. What did you do to encourage the team to help one another?  
    **Answer:** On the slack we kept on writing messages in the channel that would consist of encouraging people to ask questions if they were confused. Even if the person asking the question somehow felt bad, we would say that they don’t need to feel bad and that they can feel free to ask any questions at all. So those constant reminders as well as during our meeting we have moments where we are confused or have any questions, we make sure to provide our help to anyone who needs it since we are a team.

8. How well is the team communicating?  
    **Answer:** The team is communicating very well. We have all different types of conversations including those in which we are just checking up on one another to even work and communicate with someone who is struggling with their parts. If there are any concerns during the sprint each one of us communicates these concerns and we try to solve it as soon as possible as a team. Usually when one person sends a message, everyone sees it and responds right away. Transparency is the key to our team dynamic and we make sure that everyone knows how everyone is feeling and how everything is going.

9. Discuss expectations the team has set for one another, if any. Please highlight any changes from last week.  
    **Answer:** There have not been many new expectations, the main expectations have just been that we are expected to communicate whenever we need help or concerns. We expect to have most of the work done before recitation so that recitation is used for final touches and or quick questions. One thing that is somewhat new is that now there is an expectation that if one of us cannot meet in person it’s completely fine and we can meet on Zoom, so that we are still able to have a meeting where we are speaking face to face.

10. If anything was especially challenging or unclear, please make sure this is [1] itemized, [2] briefly described, [3] its status reported (resolved or unresolved), and [4] includes critical steps taken to find resolution.  
    **Answer:** For this sprint there was nothing really that we were confused about or found challenging, everything for the most part went smoothly and there was not much trouble that we ran into.

11. What might you suggest the team or the next PM "start", "stop", or "continue" doing in the next sprint?  
    **Answer:** First, I believe we need to start planning better. As in I believe when implementing code we should plan it before just jumping into the coding factor of the sprint. This will just help organize better and help us not start with something that might be easier than something else that needs time to successfully implement. Then I do not believe there is anything we need to stop as everything has been working successfully during our entire time as a team. Something we need to continue is supporting one another during our concerns and when we are stuck with a task. So far this has been the highlight of the team, and we just need it to continue so we can better take care of things as a team. 


## Role reporting [75 points total, 15 points each (teams of 4 get 15 free points)]
Report-out on each role, from the PM perspective.
You may seek input where appropriate, but this is primarily a PM related activity.

### Back-end

1. Overall evaluation of back-end development (how was the process? was Jira used appropriately? how were tasks created? how was completion of tasks verified?)  
    **Answer:** Backend development was completed very well and in a successful manner. I created the tasks for each member and it was set up as a checklist for each functionality that needed to be completed, for backend those were JSON responses, and routes implemented as well as the unit testing.

2. List your back-end's REST API endpoints  
    **Answer:** The endpoints were: Get for post view, Post to create a new post, Put for both likes and then also for the posts to update them, and lastly Delete for deleting a post.

3. Assess the quality of the back-end code  
    **Answer:** The code is very good and was able to have all the routes that we wanted to have and it was able to receive JSON and was able to complete all other necessary requirements

4. Describe the code review process you employed for the back-end  
    **Answer:** For the backend, what we did was after she completed everything, she then did a pull request. I first looked over the code by myself to see there is something that needs attention immediately. Thankfully there was none, then she walked me through the code she wrote and showed me how everything looks when functional

5. What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the back-end server?  
    **Answer:** There was no problem that came up during the code review. Everything that she had implemented had no problem and was easy to understand and connect with the other code.

6. Is the back-end code appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?  
    **Answer:** Yes it has the appropriate organization structure and all the files were correctly created and implemented. 

7. Are the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?  
    **Answer:** Yes, all the dependencies that were in the pom.xml were necessary and were useful for compiling and running the code. There was no unnecessary addition of dependencies.

8. Evaluate the quality of the unit tests for the back-end  
    **Answer:** The unit tests were very good and were important to test. What she tested was to see if that if connected it would get the right status code. She also checked that there was a successful response for any requests.

9. Describe any technical debt you see in the back-end  
    **Answer:** There was thankfully no technical debt as we made sure that we were implementing a good quality code and not just implementing code just to have it. Therefore in the end of the implementation we had everything we desired and had not had any technical debt.


### Admin

1. Overall evaluation of admin app development (how was the process? was Jira used appropriately? how were tasks created? how was completion of tasks verified?)  
    **Answer:** Similar to before, I created the tasks to be a checklist for all the functionality or big pieces of code that needed to be added, whenever that code was implemented it would check off one of the tasks. Therefore Jira was efficient and the development went smoothly.

2. Describe the tables created by the admin app  
    **Answer:** The tables created by the admin were really well done. It was able to tell the id of the post, the message of the post as well as the amount of likes the posts had. Those were all really important for our functionality in our program.

3. Assess the quality of the admin code  
    **Answer:** The admin code was very well done. During the testing I was able to easily check between different actions I wanted to take (creating or deleting a table) in a smooth and clean design and manner.

4. Describe the code review process you employed for the admin app  
    **Answer:** For the admin, what we did was after he completed everything, he then did a pull request. I first looked over the code by myself to see if there was something that needed attention immediately. Thankfully there was none, then he walked me through the code and showed me how to manipulate the table

5. What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the admin app?  
    **Answer:** There was no problem that came up during the code review. Everything that he had implemented had no problem and was easy to understand and connect with the other code.

6. Is the admin app code appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?  
    **Answer:** Yes the file structure was implemented correctly. All the appropriate files were in their appropriate location.

7. Are the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?  
    **Answer:** Yes, all the dependencies that were in the pom.xml were necessary and were useful for compiling and running the code. There was no unnecessary addition of dependencies.

8. Evaluate the quality of the unit tests for the admin app  
    **Answer:** The unit test was very well done, and tested multiple aspects of his code. The code tested adding and dropping a table, adding and deleting a row, and even updating a row. These tests were amazing and it was able to test everything so that we know all the code added working.

9. Describe any technical debt you see in the admin app  
    **Answer:** There was thankfully no technical debt as we made sure that we were implementing a good quality code and not just implementing code just to have it. Therefore in the end of the implementation we had everything we desired and had not had any technical debt.


### Web

1. Overall evaluation of Web development (how was the process? was Jira used appropriately? how were tasks created? how was completion of tasks verified?)  
    **Answer:** Similar to before, I created the tasks to be a checklist for all the functionality or big pieces of code that needed to be added, whenever that code was implemented it would check off one of the tasks. Therefore Jira was efficient and the development went smoothly.

2. Describe the different models and other templates used to provide the web front-end's user interface  
    **Answer:** Web was able to use different templates for the UI that allowed for a richer interaction between the user and the web program. He used “widgets” for each post and added buttons for functionality purposes and it achieved a very desirable interface.

3. Assess the quality of the Web front-end code  
    **Answer:** The quality of the code was very good, and that was seen both through my review of code and as well as seeing how the UI was working and one could see there was no problem regarding the web functionality.

4. Describe the code review process you employed for the Web front-end  
    **Answer:** For the web, what we did was after he completed everything, he then did a pull request. I first looked over the code by myself to see if there was something that needed attention immediately. Thankfully there was none, then he walked me through the code and showed me how to manipulate the table. They were all similar to each other

5. What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the Web front-end?  
    **Answer:** There was no problem that came up during the code review. Everything that he had implemented had no problem and was easy to understand and connect with the other code.

6. Is the Web front-end code appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?  
    **Answer:** Yes the file structure was implemented correctly. All the appropriate files were in their appropriate location.

7. Are the dependencies in the `package.json` file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?  
    **Answer:** Yes that was something he made sure to show me and I made sure to check, the package.json had everything appropriate and all the dependencies were necessary and implemented correctly.

8. Evaluate the quality of the unit tests for the Web front-end  
    **Answer:** The tests made sure to check that with no posts, there would be no posts available for viewing and if there was a post that had a message it would show up on the web. Everything was successful and tested for the most part the most important aspect of web front end

9. Describe any technical debt you see in the Web front-end  
    **Answer:** There was thankfully no technical debt as we made sure that we were implementing a good quality code and not just implementing code just to have it. Therefore in the end of the implementation we had everything we desired and had not had any technical debt.


### Mobile

1. Overall evaluation of Mobile development (how was the process? was Jira used appropriately? how were tasks created? how was completion of tasks verified?)  
    **Answer:** Mobile development was really well done. What was done was that I created the checkpoints for the functionality that should have been implemented, and whenever the frontend-mobile would complete a functionality it would then be moved into done.

2. Describe the activities that comprise the Mobile app  
    **Answer:** Mobile app is able to create posts, delete posts, like posts infinitely and is able to reload the app

3. Assess the quality of the Mobile code  
    **Answer:** The code is very good and provides the desired functionality for this sprint, and for the basic functionality that is needed, the code is able to complete all of it without trouble

4. Describe the code review process you employed for the Mobile front-end  
    **Answer:** For the mobile front-end, what we did was after he completed all of the functionality and finished all the unit testing, he then did a pull request. I first looked over the code by myself to see there is something that needs attention immediately. Thankfully there was none, then with him next to me he walked me through the code and how it works, and that had all the required.

5. What was the biggest issue that came up in code review of the Mobile front-end?  
    **Answer:** There was no real problem during the code review, the only problem that arose during the mobile code implementation was there was some difficulty coming up with unit tests for the mobile app, but they were able to in the end create two tests

6. Is the Mobile front-end code appropriately organized into files / classes / packages?  
    **Answer:** Yes it has the appropriate organization structure and all the files were correctly created and implemented. There was even modularity within the code so that not all the code is just stuffed into one document

7. Are the dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` (or build.gradle) file appropriate? Were there any unexpected dependencies added to the program?  
    **Answer:** Yes, only the appropriate dependencies are in the pubspec.yaml. He included only the necessary dependencies and even added the dependencies for mockito for the unit testing.

8. Evaluate the quality of the unit tests for the Mobile front-end here  
    **Answer:** The main aspects that we wanted to check for was that we can view the posts and create posts, so he tested those two aspects. To make sure that when the app is opened and connected that it shows a list of all the posts and is able to create a post within the app.

9. Describe any technical debt you see in the Mobile front-end here  
    **Answer:** There was thankfully no technical debt as we made sure that we were implementing a good quality code and not just implementing code just to have it. Therefore in the end of the implementation we had everything we desired and had not had any technical debt.


### Project Management
Self-evaluation of PM performance

1. When did your team meet with your mentor, and for how long?  
    **Answer:** We met with our mentor, Robert Kilsdonk, during the recitation twice. The first time was because of some of the last minute questions we had to ask before finishing the sprint. The second time was because we had questions regarding using the dokku and connecting it to the backend. In total the time was probably around 20-30 minutes.

2. Describe your use of Jira.  Did you have too much detail?  Too little?  Just enough? Did you implement policies around its use (if so, what were they?)?  
    **Answer:** I believe that in our use of Jira, we made sure that it had the big pieces of functionality we wanted to get done. So each functionality each role needed to create was a task on the Jira board. It was just enough to not overwhelm anyone with work, but also not too little that the person did not know what they were looking to track.

3. How did you conduct team meetings?  How did your team interact outside of these meetings?  
    **Answer:** We followed the same structure we usually have for all the meetings. First we just do a quick feeling check up on each other to see if we are all on the same page both mentally and physically to complete the sprint. Then we talk about anything that we feel could be of concern regarding the upcoming sprint. Then we plan on how we will do our work for the most part, and ask any last questions. Outside the meetings our conversations are all about work and supporting one another during the sprint.

4. What techniques (daily check-ins/scrums, team programming, timelines, Jira use, group design exercises) did you use to mitigate risk? Highlight any changes from last week.  
    **Answer:** Our main two resources we use to avoid risk in our project are Jira and Slack. Jira is useful for providing each member with what they need to complete and is a little checklist to make sure that we are in the right place on the right track and are not doing something that may risk the program and the team. The second useful resource is Slack, and that is used for communication and helps us let each other know what concerns or what problems we are running into so that others can help and we are not just working on something that we are not able to complete.

5. Describe any difficulties you faced in managing the interactions among your teammates. Were there any team issues that arose? If not, what do you believe is keeping things so constructive?  
    **Answer:** Thankfully there were no team issues that arose, and I did not have to manage much of the interactions since we all have a similar support system and understand respecting each other.

6. Describe the most significant obstacle or difficulty your team faced.  
    **Answer:** I think the biggest challenge was similar to last week and that was me having a cold. Not that my cold is so important but that since I was tired and fatigued from the cold it was slightly harder for me to check in with the other members on a daily basis, but in the end I was still able to check up and help the team on a regular basis.

7. What is your biggest concern as you think ahead to the next phase of the project? To the next sprint?  
    **Answer:** The biggest challenge that I could see is with the new sprints we might be implementing harder functionalities and if we do not start work right away that could hurt us as a team, but I believe that we have a great support system that is comfortable enough to let everyone speak about how they feel.

8. How well did you estimate time during the early part of the phase?  How did your time estimates change as the phase progressed?  
    **Answer:** For the most part the time estimates were pretty accurate. We knew that since this was a new sprint with different work than usual that we needed to start earlier so that we could finish on time, and thankfully we were able to do just that.

9. What aspects of the project would cause concern for your customer right now, if any?  
    **Answer:** There are no aspects that should currently cause any concern since we are on track in our implementation of the code that we should have. The only thing that a customer might want is more functionality, but we also need to make sure that we are not coding beyond the specifications.
